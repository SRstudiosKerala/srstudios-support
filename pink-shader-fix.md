# ðŸŽ¨ How to Fix "Pink Materials" in Unity (Shader Graph Issues)

Sometimes, models or prefabs appear **pink** in your scene. This happens when Unity cannot render the material because the required shader or render pipeline setup is missing or misconfigured.

---

## ðŸ›  Affected Assets
This fix applies to assets like:
- ðŸ‘» Animated Ghost Shader
- ðŸ§¬ Cyber Shader and Props  
- ðŸŽ¨ Abstract BG Shader  
- And other Shader Graphâ€“based packs

## âœ… Solution 1: Check Your Unity Version

Ensure you're using a Unity version that supports Shader Graph and the correct Render Pipeline.

> âœ… **Recommended Version:**  
> Unity **2021.3.24f1 LTS** (or newer)  
> This asset was tested and submitted using this version.

---

## âœ… Solution 2: Install Shader Graph Package

Sometimes the pink issue happens because Shader Graph is not installed in your project.

**Steps to install Shader Graph:**

1. Go to `Window â†’ Package Manager`
2. In the top-left dropdown, select **Unity Registry**
3. Search for **Shader Graph**
4. Click **Install** (Install version 12.1.11 or newer)

## âœ… Solution 3: Add Active Targets to Shader Graph

If the shader still appears pink, you may need to manually configure the **Active Targets** in the Shader Graph.

**Steps:**

1. Open the Shader Graph folder for the asset  
   _(Example: `Assets â†’ [Asset Folder] â†’ Shadergraph`)_

2. Double-click to open each `.shadergraph` file in Unity  
   _(There may be more than one â€” repeat the steps below for each)_

3. In the **Graph Inspector** window, click **Graph Settings**

4. Under **Active Targets**, click the **`+` button**  
   Add the render pipeline you're using:
   - **URP** â€“ Add URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
   - **Built-in** â€“ Add Built-in Render Pipeline
   - **HDRP** â€“ Add HDRP if you're using it

5. Save the shader and return to the scene â€” the pink material should be gone.

## ðŸ’¡ Still Pink?

If your issue is not solved by the steps above:

- Try right-clicking the shader file and selecting **Reimport**
- Or right-click the asset folder and select **Reimport All**
- Make sure your **Graphics settings** in `Edit â†’ Project Settings â†’ Graphics` are configured for the correct pipeline
