## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Can I use the asset in commercial games?
**A:** Yes! All assets from SR Studios Kerala are royalty-free and licensed for use in **both personal and commercial** Unity projects.

### Q2: I see pink materials in the asset (e.g., Ghost Shader, Cyber Shader, Abstract BG Shader)

**A:** Pink materials mean Unity can’t render the shader correctly — usually due to a mismatch in the Render Pipeline (URP/Built-in/HDRP).

We’ve created a quick fix guide to help with this issue:

👉 [How to Fix Pink Shader Issue](pink-shader-fix.md)

### Q3: Are your assets beginner-friendly?

**A:** Yes. Most assets are designed to be easy to drag and drop into your project. Many tools and shaders also come with demo scenes and documentation.

### Q4: I have a feature request. Can I share it?

**A:**  Of course! We love hearing from users. Just send your ideas to srstudioskerala@gmail.com and we’ll consider them for future updates.
